# TODO-List
# This TODO-List is for people that can check out what they have been doing and what they are going to do later
# Added more code and more labels for people to write what tasks they want to make
# Added headline fo people to write by their own what kind of list they want to make
# Added variables for my input, box and list
# Made buttons work with click function
# Added some comments to tell what the different lines does
# The function and purpose with this TODO-list is for people so they wont forget and just add more tasks they want to do and what they need for example a shoppinglist or a bucketlist
# When the page loades, the account or user will be entered in to the input box to write right away without having to click the box
# This shows what kind of quests/tasks and list the user want to make
# It will make a list when the tasks are added
# If for example the user accidently add a typo in the task, they can delete the task by clicking "slett" or the delete button
# When user is finished/done with the task, they can check of in the checkbox to make it checked so its done.
# When a task is done, and the checkbox is checked, there will come a line across the task which marks it as done
# Users also have the ability to hit enter instead of clicking the "legg til" button to add a task to the list
# The max length of number of characters in 1 task is 20
# A delete all button to remove all the tasks in 1 click
